""" Package containing Tessellator class

Contents:
    tessellator: a class that provides functionality of generating Archimedian tilings
    or tessellations. There are 11 types of regular tessellations. The generator will
    either try to fill some kind of bounding figure or run for a set number of recursive
    iterations.
    The class requires shapely for proper functioning.
